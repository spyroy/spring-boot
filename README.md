# spring-boot

short project to experience spring boot.
In this project i created a fake database to implemant spring boot application,
to test it I used postman to post and get requests.

To do so i simply run the program, open postman with "localhost:8080/api/v1/person" 
than i can post a person to add it to the databese, get - to see all persons in the database
put - to modify existing person and delete - to delete existing person.
